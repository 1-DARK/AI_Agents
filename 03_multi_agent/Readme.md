Multi-agent system design patterns
There are many ways to compose agents together. Two patterns we regularly see in production apps are:

Manager (agents as tools) – a central agent owns the conversation and invokes specialized agents that are exposed as tools.

Handoffs – the initial agent delegates the entire conversation to a specialist once it has identified the user’s request.
